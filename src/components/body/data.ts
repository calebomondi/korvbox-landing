    question: "How does Korvbox work?",
    answer: "Korvbox allows users to supply stablecoins into Morpho Protocol, where they can earn yield by providing liquidity to verified borrowers. The process is fully transparent and on Base mainnet."
  },
  {
    question: "Why should I supply through Korvbox instead of Morpho directly?",
    answer: "Korvbox abstracts Morpho's complexity making it easier for anybody to earn from their digital assets without needing to be a crypto guru. Additionally, we support only stablecoins."
  },
  {
    question: "What stablecoins are supported?",
    answer: "We currently only support USDC. As we grow, We will continuously evaluate additional stablecoins to expand our offerings based on user demand."
  },
  {
    question: "How much yield can I earn when i supply?",
    answer: "Yield rates vary based on market conditions and borrowing demand in the Morpho Protocol vaults. Current rates are displayed in real-time on your dashboard, and historical APY data is available to help you track performance over time."
  },
  {
    question: "Does Korvbox charge any fees?",
    answer: "Korvbox only charges a fixed 0.1 USDC service fee on all deposit amounts, there are no withdrawal fees neither penalties. Morpho vaults charge performance fee which is already subtracted from the total APY to earn, hence, the displayed APY on each vault is the net APY that one your supply will earn."

  },
  {
    question: "Can I withdraw my USDC anytime?",
    answer: "Yes, Morpho vaults allows instant withdrawals if there's enough liquidity, if not, the withdrawal might delay as the vaults pull funds from the markets it supplied to."
  },
  {
    question: "How safe is Korvbox?",
    answer: "Korvbox smart contracts that integrate with Morpho Protocol have been auditied. All the shares recieved from supplying to Morpho vaults go directly to the users wallet and they can with interact and perform all operations on the vaults directly through Morpho, no assets stay on Korvbox's contracts."
